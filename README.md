# WeirdText

This is my solution of _WeirdText_ that you can find in [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md)

## How to start the app
```
npm install
npm test
```

## Next steps

### Improvements
[ ] `Encoder`: integrate encode
[ ] `decode`: create decode function
[ ] `Decoder`: integrate decoder
[ ] `encode`: improve shuffle function
[ ] ``
[ ] do I need services/helper?
[ ] improve folder structure
[ ] `npm audit`: found 67 vulnerabilities (63 low, 2 moderate, 2 high) in 36437 scanned packages
[ ] missing `test.todo`: it looks like `test.todo` is not a function, while it is a Jest function

## Assignment checklists

###Â Definition of done

[ ] The encoder implementation is necessary to us in order to consider the task done
[ ] The decoder implementation is a plus
[ ] Unit tests are a plus
[ ] Styling the tool (with CSS or styled-components) is a plus

### Implementation hints

[x] We suggest you to go with TDD
[-] We suggest you to implement the encoder first. It's easier than the decoder.
[ ] You can split the tool into components/utils at your will. We actually suggest you to split it.
[ ] Using additional external dependencies would lower the evaluation score

### Score

The score will depend on the following evaluation criteria (alphabetically sorted):

- Code notes/comments
- Code quality
- Coding style
- Decoding algorithm
- Encoding algorithm
- Knowledge of React
- Tests
- Tool architecture
