# WeirdText

This is my solution of _WeirdText_ that you can find in [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md)

## How to start the app
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing
Test the app with `npm test`

## Next steps

### Improvements
- [x] `Encoder`: integrate encode
- [x] `decode`: create decode function
- [x] `Decoder`: integrate decoder
- [x] `encode`: improve shuffle function
- [x] do I need services/helpers?
- [x] is the folder structure clear enough?
- [x] should I try TypeScript?
- [x] missing `test.todo`: it looks like `test.todo` is not a function, while it is a Jest function

## Assignment checklists

###Â Definition of done

- [x] The encoder implementation is necessary to us in order to consider the task done
- [x] The decoder implementation is a plus
- [x] Unit tests are a plus
- [ ] Styling the tool (with CSS or styled-components) is a plus

### Implementation hints

- [x] We suggest you to go with TDD
- [x] We suggest you to implement the encoder first. It's easier than the decoder.
- [x] You can split the tool into components/utils at your will. We actually suggest you to split it.
- [x] Using additional external dependencies would lower the evaluation score
  > only faker and sinon for testing

### Score

The score will depend on the following evaluation criteria (alphabetically sorted):

- Code notes/comments
- Code quality
- Coding style
- Decoding algorithm
- Encoding algorithm
- Knowledge of React
- Tests
- Tool architecture
